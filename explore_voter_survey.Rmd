This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
voter_18_raw <- read_csv("data/VOTER_Survey_April18_Release1.csv")
```
```{r}

voter_18<- gather(voter_18_raw,"question","answer",
                  -caseid,
                  -pid3_2018,
                  -race_2018,
                  -gender_2018,
                  -faminc_new_2018
                  ) %>% as_tibble() %>%
  filter(!is.na(caseid)) %>% 
  filter(str_detect(question,"_2018")) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(answer)) %>% 
  distinct()
save(voter_18,file="data/voter_18.rdata")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
